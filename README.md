My try on making cross-platform online Chess.
This is my first bigger .NET project im using to learn about depper concept of .NET and full-stack development in general.

## Build
Clone repository, and build it in Visual Studio 2022.

This repo is a whole VS solution. It contains many .NET projects.
There are class library projects for buisness logic and network logic, and there are UI projects.
